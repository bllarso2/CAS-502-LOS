# CAS-502-LOS
For CAS 502, this repository is to host our files pertaining to the final project: predicting hospital length of stay. 
Team members: Brad Larson and Dave Cooper


In the healthcare industry forecasting errors in length-of-stay (LOS) can lead to significant revenue losses. Overestimating or underestimating LOS affects staffing, resource allocation, and patient flow, while also increasing the risk of penalties, poor patient outcomes, and lost market opportunities. Healthcare organizations require more accurate and data-driven models to improve their LOS predictions and optimize operational efficiency.

Our project aims to enhance LOS forecasting by incorporating additional factors, such as lifestyle choices (e.g., diet, exercise, tobacco, and alcohol use). By leveraging both computational models and agent-based modeling (ABM), we intend to build an interactive dashboard that allows users to adjust lifestyle variables and observe their impact on LOS predictions.

Basic Features:
To address the problem, we propose the following core functionalities:
David Cooper: Develop a computational regression model to predict LOS using hospital-provided data.
Brad Larson: Integrate lifestyle factors into an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate their impact on LOS predictions.
Build an interactive dashboard where users can adjust lifestyle factors and observe their effect on LOS estimates.


Nice-to-Have Features
If time allows, we will incorporate additional functionalities, including:
Advanced Computational Models: Enhancing predictive accuracy using machine learning techniques beyond basic regression.
Agent-Based Simulation: Implementing an ABM to dynamically simulate different patient populations and interactions.
Revenue Projection Model: Estimating financial impact based on predicted LOS ranges over 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years.
Comparative Analysis: Benchmarking LOS predictions against other hospitals (local, regional, national).
Web-Based Dashboard: Making our model accessible via a web-based interface for real-time interaction.
