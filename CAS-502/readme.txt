Description of the problem you are trying to solve
In the healthcare industry forecasting errors around length-of-stay (LOS) can lead to significant revenue losses. The impact of overestimating or underestimating LOS can lead to inefficiencies in staffing, resource allocation, and patient flow, while also increasing the risk of penalties, poor outcomes, and lost market opportunities.
