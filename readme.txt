Description of the problem you are trying to solve
In the healthcare industry forecasting errors around length-of-stay (LOS) can lead to significant revenue losses. The impact of overestimating or underestimating LOS can lead to inefficiencies in staffing, resource allocation, and patient flow, while also increasing the risk of penalties, poor outcomes, and lost market opportunities. 




To help solve this problem the proposed solution is to take existing data from a hospital client and begin to integrate other factors such as lifestyle to increase probability in forecasting LOS. Using asset based modeling the intent is to create an interactive dashboard allowing for users to test different lifestyles against a baseline average LOS to see if more accurate predictions are available. 


Original Discussion Post:
I loved reading through the proposed projects above. Impressive! Alas, mine is not so impressive--at least not at the outset. I'm hoping to do something that's pretty simple: Predict length-of-stay (LoS) for a hospital client of mine using a mix of computational and agent-based models. The first part is fairly straightforward because I've already done it--but I use Dataiku for most of these issues. It brings data science, ML, and AI together in a fairly easy-to-use format. But I'd like to take the patient data and write a Python program that could do the same.
Since healthcare in the US is big business (unfortunately), prediction errors in length-of-stay can lead to significant revenue losses. I know this because my lovely wife is a healthcare exec. With the data I have from a client, writing code to predict LoS is, as I said, relatively straightforward--so straightforward I'm sure I could do it even with my mediocre coding skills (I orignally used a regression model in Dataiku, so doing the same in Python isn't that much of a stretch). But then it would be interesting to see how lifestyle factors, like alcohol, tobacco use, exercise, and diet, might contribute to a patient's LoS and how such factors might contribute to more accurate forecasting. Since I don't have access to such data, this could be an area where I bring in an ABM, using sliders, perhaps, to increase or decrease parameters and see how it might impact the original prediction from the Python model.
