This seems to be the communication plan! 
Communication plan to support the proejct:
  - At this time we are communicating almost daily through email around the project. We are discussing our findings on other datas sets in addition to studies we find around LOS. 
  - When needed we have the ability to tag up virtually or phone call for 15 minutes, but at this time due to our consistent communication email has been satisfactory. 
  - Using GIT hub we can no work on our future code here and manage our workflows without inefficient sharing. 

Google Drive: A shared repository for storing project-related files and documents.

Email: Our primary communication channel for formal updates and discussions.

Scheduled Meetings: Regular virtual check-ins to review progress, address challenges, and adjust our approach as needed.

Independent Work Sessions: Given our differing schedules, we will balance individual contributions with collaborative review meetings to stay on track.
