This seems to be the communication plan! 
Communication plan to support the proejct:
  - At this time we are communicating almost daily through email around the project. We are discussing our findings on other datas sets in addition to studies we find around LOS. 
  - When needed we have the ability to tag up virtually or phone call for 15 minutes, but at this time due to our consistent communication email has been satisfactory. 
  - Using GIT hub we can no work on our future code here and manage our workflows without inefficient sharing.
