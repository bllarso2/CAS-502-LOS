Coding, for one. I'm pretty much at the extent of what I can do computationally. Not sure about Brad. I can add some pretty graphs. 
I'd like to incorporate co-morbidities (which will be dummy data). Not sure if we add that in the Python model or in an agent-based model. I'm more comfortable doing something like that in NetLogo.
